ðŸ—“ 07.2015 â€“ 04.2016 / *10 months*

ðŸ”§ Qt, SVN

**Position algorithm.** I created algorithm to position laser tool in several modes: scan, shortest path from one point to another and so on. This problem contains a lot of fun problems in stereometry.

**Bus.** I wrote code for module that connects about 20 different components of product (motors, sensors, power and so on). Also this module make a health-check for all of this components with their own protocols based on protobuf.

ðŸ”§ Python, LaTeX

**Algorithms.** I solved aircraft navigation problems and created different algorithms for them.
For example, how to find optimum trajectory to land down aircraft with a lot of restrictions such that total mass, current fuel level, hight, wind direction, current aircraft velocity and so on.
Or navigation problem for several aircrafts: find optimum trajectory to aircraft relative to others (taking off, landing, cruise formation).
