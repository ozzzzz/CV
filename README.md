**Algorithms.** I solved aircraft navigation problems and created different algorithms for them.
For example, how to find optimum trajectory to land down aircraft with a lot of restrictions such that total mass, current fuel level, hight, wind direction, current aircraft velocity and so on.
Or navigation problem for several aircrafts: find optimum trajectory to aircraft relative to others (taking off, landing, cruise formation).

### Junior web-developer
