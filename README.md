Hi, my name is Bogdan. I am ...

Before my experience, I would like to say a few words about my interests.

## Interests

Briefly, I have two groups of interests: 1) reduce the impact of humanity on the environment and 2) improve the quality of life of people.
In both cases, I have areas that are more interesting to me then others.

Reduce the impact of humanity on the environment:
* renewable energy,
* garbage recycling,
* eco-friendly packaging,
* consumption optimization.

Improve the quality of life of people:
* robotics in different areas,
* pharmaceuticals,

**Algorithms.** I solved aircraft navigation problems and created different algorithms for them.
For example, how to find optimum trajectory to land down aircraft with a lot of restrictions such that total mass, current fuel level, hight, wind direction, current aircraft velocity and so on.
Another example is navigation problem for several aircrafts: find the optimum trajectory of the aircraft relative to other (taking off, landing, cruise formation).
